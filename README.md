# KARIGHAR

On-demand home-services marketplace for Pakistan (Karachi). Web-first PWA.
Next.js 16 + Supabase. See [`../BUILD_SPEC.md`](../BUILD_SPEC.md) for the full product spec.

## Run it locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 — the landing page runs without any backend yet.

## Connect Supabase (needed for auth, booking, providers)

1. Create a free project at https://supabase.com.
2. In the project's **SQL Editor**, run [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql).

   **That's the whole thing** — tables, triggers, security policies, the
   verification storage bucket, realtime, and the seeded Karachi catalog.
   Every patch below is already folded into it, so a new project needs
   nothing else.

<details>
<summary>Upgrading an <strong>existing</strong> database? Run the patches you've missed, in order.</summary>

   - [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql) — tables, security policies, seeded Karachi catalog.
   - [`supabase/patch_v2.sql`](supabase/patch_v2.sql) — provider job access, rating trigger, verification storage bucket.
   - [`supabase/patch_v3_realtime.sql`](supabase/patch_v3_realtime.sql) — **required** for live chat, live location tracking, and live status updates.
   - [`supabase/patch_v4_business_logic.sql`](supabase/patch_v4_business_logic.sql) — **required**: server-enforced pricing/status/reviews, COD payment + commission ledger, and notifications.
   - [`supabase/patch_v5_settlements_disputes.sql`](supabase/patch_v5_settlements_disputes.sql) — **required**: commission-settlement RPC + disputes admin access.
   - [`supabase/patch_v6_price_lock.sql`](supabase/patch_v6_price_lock.sql) — **required**: locks a job's price once set (anti-tamper), lets Pros price quote jobs, and rate-limits bookings.
   - [`supabase/patch_v7_provider_profiles.sql`](supabase/patch_v7_provider_profiles.sql) — **required**: public provider-profile view (for `/providers/[id]`) + cancellation-reason column.
   - [`supabase/patch_v8_role_escalation.sql`](supabase/patch_v8_role_escalation.sql) — **required (security)**: blocks users from making themselves admin.
   - [`supabase/patch_v9_fix_jobs_rls.sql`](supabase/patch_v9_fix_jobs_rls.sql) — **required (critical)**: fixes job visibility so approved providers can see/accept the open job pool.
   - [`supabase/patch_v10_fix_notify_cast.sql`](supabase/patch_v10_fix_notify_cast.sql) — **required (critical)**: fixes an enum-cast crash that blocked all status updates past "assigned".
   - [`supabase/patch_v11_lock_provider_pii.sql`](supabase/patch_v11_lock_provider_pii.sql) — **required (security)**: `providers` was world-readable, exposing CNIC numbers and document paths to anyone with the anon key. Locks the table to owner/admin and serves public pro data from the `public_provider_profiles` view instead. Re-creates that view, so it also covers a project where patch_v7 was skipped.
     *(Patches are idempotent and safe to re-run.)*

See [`../LAUNCH_READINESS.md`](../LAUNCH_READINESS.md) for the full architect audit and
[`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) for the production (Vercel) checklist.
3. Copy `.env.local.example` → `.env.local` and fill in your project's **URL** and key
   (Project Settings → API). The **publishable key** goes in `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   (or `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` — either name works).
4. **For fast testing:** in Supabase → **Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Email**,
   turn **off** "Confirm email" so signups log in instantly. (Turn it back on for production.)
5. Restart `npm run dev`.

### Make yourself an admin

After signing up once, find your user id in Supabase → Authentication → Users, then run in SQL Editor:

```sql
update profiles set role = 'admin' where id = 'YOUR-USER-ID';
```

Now `/admin` unlocks (verify providers, manage catalog, monitor jobs).

### Google Maps

`NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` must have **Maps JavaScript API** and **Geocoding API**
enabled (Google Cloud Console → APIs). If you set HTTP-referrer restrictions, allow
`http://localhost:3000/*` and your production domain.

### Google sign-in (optional)

The "Continue with Google" button needs the Google provider enabled in Supabase:
Supabase → **Authentication → Providers → Google**, paste your `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and add `https://YOUR-PROJECT.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
as an authorized redirect URI in Google Cloud Console.

## Try the full flow

1. Sign up as a **customer** → `/book` → book an AC service.
2. In another browser/incognito, sign up as a **provider** → `/pro/onboarding` → submit.
3. As **admin**, go to `/admin/providers` → approve the provider.
4. As the **provider** → `/pro/dashboard` → accept the job → advance status.
5. Back as the **customer** → `/bookings/[id]` → watch it update live, chat, then rate.

- [x] Disputes: "report a problem" on jobs + admin resolution UI
- [x] Automated tests (Vitest) for money/accounting + status state-machine
- [ ] Phone OTP auth (needs an SMS provider) — replaces email/password
- [ ] Email notifications + Sentry monitoring + rate limiting (P1)
- [ ] Escrow + online payments (JazzCash/Easypaisa) · Directions/ETA (P2)

## Testing

```bash
npm test        # Vitest unit tests (money/accounting, status machine, validation)
npm run build   # type-check + production build
```

## Demo videos (customer / provider / admin walkthroughs)

Records MP4 walkthroughs of each role using Playwright + ffmpeg.

```bash
# 1. Put the real service-role (secret) key in .env.local: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
# 2. Seed demo accounts (creates confirmed customer/provider/admin):
node --env-file=.env.local scripts/seed.mjs
# 3. Make sure the dev server is running (npm run dev), then:
node scripts/record.mjs                 # all three
node scripts/record.mjs customer        # or one role
```

Output MP4s land in `videos/`. Demo logins use password `Karighar#2026`.

## Email notifications (deploy Monday)

Scaffold in `supabase/functions/send-notification-email/`. Deploy with a Resend key
and a Database Webhook on `notifications` INSERT — see the file header for steps.

        <Section title="What we collect">
          Account details (name, phone, email), your service addresses and location (to match and
          route Pros), booking history, ratings, chat messages, and — for Pros — CNIC and a selfie
          for identity verification.
        </Section>
        <Section title="How we use it">
          To provide the service: match you with Pros, enable live tracking and chat, process
          bookings, prevent fraud, and improve KARIGHAR. Pro verification documents are used only to
          confirm identity and are stored privately.
        </Section>
        <Section title="Sharing">
          We share only what&apos;s necessary to complete a job (e.g. a Pro sees the job address and your
          name/phone once assigned). We do not sell your personal data.
        </Section>
        <Section title="Location">
          A Pro&apos;s live location is shared with the customer only while a job is active. Your address is
          shared with the assigned Pro only.
        </Section>
        <Section title="Security & retention">
          Data is stored securely with access controls. Verification images are kept in a private,
          restricted store. You may request deletion of your account and data.
